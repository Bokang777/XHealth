# XHealth

This is XHealth, a medical app that uses machine learning technologies to diagnose an MRI scans for viral pneumonia.

The app uses inferencing and gives a probability or likelyhood of a person having viral pneumonia. 

This app was trained uses over 6000 chest medical images(MRI) that were found on medical journals.

I developed XHealth because I had an aunt of died because pneumonia and if it had been diagnosed sooner she might have had a fighting chance.

The fact that our medical institutions are overwhelmed by covid is bad enough so I'd like this app to help save one or two people out there.

Early diagnosis can help save a life.
